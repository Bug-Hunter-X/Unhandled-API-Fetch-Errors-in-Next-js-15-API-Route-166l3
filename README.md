# Unhandled API Fetch Errors in Next.js 15 API Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 API routes: the failure to handle errors during `fetch` calls.  The `data.js` file shows an API route that attempts to fetch data but lacks error handling.  This can lead to silent failures and unexpected behavior in your application.

The `dataSolution.js` file provides a solution by implementing proper error handling using `try...catch` blocks and returning appropriate error responses.
